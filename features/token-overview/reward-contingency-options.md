# Reward Contingency Options

We understand that crypto is still a volatile market for the time being, and projects may change or fail. While our reflection reward tokens were chosen carefully based on several factors, we know that those conditions could change.

To safeguard against our holders being stuck with defunct token rewards, PepperBird token can change reflection partners on-chain without reintroducing the token.

Our policy is that any change will be communicated thirty days before action and will only occur if changes in the reflection token cause an unviable reward.
