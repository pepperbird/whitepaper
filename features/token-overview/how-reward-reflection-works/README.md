# How Reward/Reflection Works

The Reflection Pool receives 6% from the fee generated from users' buy/sell transactions. Once the Reflection Pool reaches 0.005% of our total token supply of 100 Trillion, an automated request is made with AMA provider Pancake Swap to purchase preselected reward tokens for distribution.

Once the reward tokens are purchased, they are distributed to the crypto wallets of all token holders based on the percentages of their held tokens.

Disabling reflections on administration accounts ensure reflections are disbursed accurately based on percentages to investors wallets.
