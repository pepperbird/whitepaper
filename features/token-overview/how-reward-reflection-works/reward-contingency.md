# Reward Contingency

We understand that crypto is still a volatile market, and projects may change or fail. While our reflection reward tokens were chosen carefully based on several factors, we know that those conditions could change.

$PepperBird is designed with the capability to change reflection on-chain without reintroducing a new token in the event a selected rewards no longer proves beneficial.

Our policy is that any change to the selected rewards will be communicated thirty days before any action is taken unless an emergency change should arise because a token ceases to exist.

If a situation of that nature should arise, you will be notified of the change via our multiple social accounts.
