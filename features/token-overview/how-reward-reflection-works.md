# How Reward/Reflection Works

The Reflection Pool receives 6% from the fee generated from users' transactions using the PepperBird Token. Once the Reflection Pool reaches 0.005% of the total token supply of a 100 Trillion, an automated request is made with AMA provider Pancake Swap to purchase preselected reward tokens for distribution.

Once the reward tokens are purchased, they are distributed to the crypto wallet of all token holders based on the percentage of the token held.

There are some caveats to this process that is important to note. PepperBird Finance administrative wallets do not gain reflections and will not be part of the reward split allocation. In addition, Founders wallets are exempted from the reward distribution.

Disabling reflections on administration accounts ensure reflections are deposited to the holder's wallets and not collected in the wallets of the organization.
