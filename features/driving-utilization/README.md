# Driving Utilization

Building utilization for PepperBird Token is vital because it helps drive everything else behind the scene. While enabling gasless transactions is one stop on our utilization roadmap, it is one component of the systems we are building.

PepperBird Finance is more than just a pretty token. For us, the token is the engine that will power our main development goals.

PepperBird Finance is built around merging the management of fiat and crypto wealth under one umbrella. Our core strength is building applications, utilizing advances in software technology, simplifying our process, and making those APIs available for others to use and take advantage of. With this in mind, the token will serve as a gateway to accessing our suite of decentralized apps built around token finance and as a means for accessing and using advanced features of our JenFin App.

Our immediate plans are outlined in the upcoming section; please refer to the roadmap for more details on future applications.

Our team has taken a modular design approach where base functionality goes live. Each additional feature comes online as features are added; an overview of how these products work and the utility they provide will be updated here.
