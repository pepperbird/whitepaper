# Revenue Model

The Revenue Stack represents the suite of products we are bringing online. Marketing spend will be used to drive visibility, engagement, and use of these products.

The revenue from these products fund the reflection pool. In addition, AMM and Wallet activities also provide a source of funding. Our long-term goal is to have a diversified suite of products to ensure a continued source of revenue for token holders.
