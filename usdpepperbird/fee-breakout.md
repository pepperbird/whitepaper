# Fee Breakout

No one likes fees, not even us, but they are an essential part of what helps keep PepperBird Finance viable. PepperBird Token deducts a fee on most transactions to drive rewards and continue building stakeholder value.

### Our Fees Explained Simply

For every transaction not on a PepperBird Finance or partner site, **12 PEPPERBIRD** is deducted for every **100 PEPPERBIRD** tokens sent. If you sent 100 tokens to a friend, they would receive 88 PEPPERBIRD tokens.

A detailed list of situations where a fee is not deducted will be updated before token launch.
