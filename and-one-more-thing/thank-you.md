# Thank You

Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. I hope this was as much fun for you to read as it was for us to write. :)

In all seriousness though, we are only human carving a small piece in this new landscape. We strive to be open and clear in this document. If you find any mistakes or areas that seem vague, or would like a segment explained in more detail drop into our Telegram group and let us know. We appericate the feedback.
